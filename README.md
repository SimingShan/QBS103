- `QBS103_GSE157103_series_matrix.csv`: CSV file with series matrix data.
- `boxplot.png`: Boxplot of gene expression by sex and disease status.
- `gene_histogram.png`: Histogram of gene expression.
- `hist_plot.png`: Historical plot of gene expression data.
- `scatter_plot.png`: Scatter plot of gene expression vs. age.
